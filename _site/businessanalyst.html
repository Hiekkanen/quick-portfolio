      <h1 id="business-analyst">Business Analyst</h1>

<p><strong>Software:</strong> Blue Prism
<br />
<strong>Certifications:</strong> Blue Prism Professional Developer
<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> I worked one year as a Robotic Process Automation developer for <a href="www.digitalworkforce.fi">Digital Workforce</a> creating automated workflows for Healthcare and Public Sector clients.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-robotic-process-automation">What is Robotic Process Automation?</h3>

<p>Robotic Process Automation is a technology to automate repetitive human tasks. The techniques are platform-agnostic and make it possible to create automated processes that connect with multiple softwares to create automated workflows.
<br />
RPA is useful when it is important to be able to rapidly develop new capabilities on top of an existing software stack.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-i-learn">What did I learn?</h3>

<p>The workflows in developing RPA-solutions are very similar to those of software development. In order for different people involved in a project to be able to work together efficiently it is important to have a clear vision how to structure a project into classes and methods.</p>

<p>Precise <strong>Documentation</strong> is important to properly define and communicate the functionality of a solution.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-this-experience-be-used-in-the-future">How can this experience be used in the future?</h3>

<p>When working with a client there are circumstances at which it is beneficial to integrate RPA-tools as one  part of the software stack. In order for the legacy technologies to be integrated to a new software solution RPA can provide the bridge between the new and the old software.</p>
