### Introduction




## Why do I wanna be a Full-Stack developer?

Being able to develop services is the next level of digital literacy. In order to be able to leverage other skills and competencies in the future, being able to develop them is vital.

## How can I contribute immediately?

I have extensive experience with robotic process automation, and I have a clear picture of how RPA can fit into the big picture of a new development. I am intimately familiar with the restrictions and opportunities of using RPA technologies.

### RPA Project management
I have experience with RPA projects, I can contribute in RPA projects immediately either in a project management role or as a developer.

### RPA Development
I have the highest developer certification within the Blue Prism ecosystem, and if a customer insists on another software, the skills are transferable to other RPA platforms with minimal training.

While my experience is within the Blue Prism ecosystem, the emergent techonolgy is UiPath. UiPath and BP run with the same technologies under the hood, thus changing to the other is relaitvely easy.

## How can I leverage my experience?

I have experience with software development through my RPA career. While the software used is proprietary, the projects share many similarities. Documentation, project management and patterns how to organize code are similar. Also having a routine of developing helps with learning new languages and paragigms.
