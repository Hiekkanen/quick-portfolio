### What is Robotic Process Automation?

Robotic Process Automation is a technology to automate repetitive human tasks. The techniques are platform-agnostic and make it possible to create automated processes that connect with multiple softwares to create automated workflows.

RPA is useful when it is important to be able to rapidly develop new capabilities on top of an existing software stack.

### What did I learn?

The workflows in developing RPA-solutions are very similar to those of software development. In order for different people involved in a project to be able to work together efficiently it is important to have a clear vision how to structure a project into classes and methods.

Precise **Documentation** is important to properly define and communicate the functionality of a solution.

### How can this experience be used in the future?

When working with a client there are circumstances at which it is beneficial to integrate RPA-tools as one  part of the software stack. In order for the legacy technologies to be integrated to a new software solution RPA can provide the bridge between the new and the old software.
